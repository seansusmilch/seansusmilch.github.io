I recently switched to using almost exclusively Proxmox LXC containers with docker and NFS for my homelab services. These are the steps I follow to set one up.

## Table of contents
## Set up LXC container with Docker
1.  Create LXC container with this [helper script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=docker).
```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/raw/main/ct/docker.sh)"
```
> I just use all the default settings. No Portainer, no docker-compose, nothing...
2. Make new user "sean"
```bash
adduser sean
```
3. Add user to `docker` and `sudo` groups
```shell
usermod -aG docker sean
usermod -aG sudo sean
```
4. Make docker folder and link it to root directory 
```bash
mkdir /home/sean/docker
ln -s /home/sean/docker /docker
```
5. Add ssh key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
6. In Proxmox, set static IP and DNS
7. Ensure docker is able to pull and run images by running the following
```bash
docker run hello-world
docker image rm -f hello-world
```
## Setting up NFS

In order to use NFS inside LXC, you need to have a privileged container. Follow these steps to convert your container to privileged in Proxmox.

1. Shut down the container if running
2. Backup container
3. Restore container but change Privilege Level to `Privileged`
4. Under Options > Features, check the NFS feature
5. Boot it up
6. Install nfs-common
```bash
apt update && apt install -y nfs-common
```
7. Update `/etc/fstab`
8. Create mountpoints
```bash
mkdir /mnt/share1 /mnt/share2 /mnt/share3
```
9. Mount all mountpoints
```bash
sudo mount -va
```
