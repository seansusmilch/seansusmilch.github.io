## 🏗️ Architecture Deep Dive

  

### Database Schema Design

  

The application uses a well-structured database schema with seven main collections:

  

#### Core Collections

  

**Users Collection**

```typescript

export const UserZ = BaseZ.extend({

  email: z.string().email(),

  username: z.string(),

  avatar: z.string(),

  bio: z.string(),

  avatar_url: z.string().url().optional(),

  settings: UserSettingsZ.nullable().default(UserSettingsZ.parse({})),

});

```

  

**Matchups Collection**

```typescript

export const MatchupZ = BaseZ.extend({

  code: z.string().length(15),

  time_utc: z.string(),

  home_code: z.string().length(3),

  away_code: z.string().length(3),

  home_meta: z.object({

    wins: z.number().min(0),

    losses: z.number().min(0),

  }).nullable(),

  away_meta: z.object({

    wins: z.number().min(0),

    losses: z.number().min(0),

  }).nullable(),

  scoreboard: z.string().length(15).or(z.literal('')),

});

```

  

**Picks Collection** - The heart of the prediction system

```typescript

export const PickZ = BaseZ.extend({

  matchup: z.string().length(15),

  win_prediction: z.string().length(3),

  comment: z.string(),

  user: z.string().length(15),

  status: z.string(),

  result: z.string(),

  expand: z.object({

    user: UserZ,

    matchup: MatchupZ,

  }).optional(),

});

```

  

#### Supporting Collections

- **Scoreboards** - Live game scores and status

- **Reactions** - Social interactions on picks

- **Stats** - User performance metrics

- **Feedback** - User suggestions and bug reports

  

### Type Safety with Zod

  

One of the standout features is the comprehensive type safety implemented through Zod schemas. Every data structure is validated both at runtime and compile time, ensuring data integrity across the entire application:

  

```typescript

// Runtime validation with compile-time types

export type UserType = z.infer<typeof UserZ>;

export type MatchupType = z.infer<typeof MatchupZ>;

export type PickType = z.infer<typeof PickZ>;

```

  

### Server-Side Architecture

  

The application leverages Astro's server-side rendering capabilities with a hybrid approach:

  

```javascript

// astro.config.mjs

export default defineConfig({

  output: 'server',

  adapter: node({

    mode: 'standalone',

  }),

  integrations: [react()],

  prefetch: {

    prefetchAll: true,

    defaultStrategy: 'tap',

  },

});

```

  

This configuration provides:

- **Server-side rendering** for optimal performance and SEO

- **React hydration** for interactive components

- **Intelligent prefetching** for smooth navigation

- **Standalone deployment** capability

## 🎯 Key Features Implementation

  

### 1. Real-Time NBA Data Integration

  

The platform includes sophisticated data fetching mechanisms through cron jobs:

  

```typescript

// Automated data synchronization

export class BatchOperationTracker {

  private logger: Logger;

  private successCount: number = 0;

  private errorCount: number = 0;

  recordSuccess(itemId?: string): void {

    this.successCount++;

    this.processedItems++;

    this.maybeLogProgress(itemId);

  }

  recordError(error: any, itemId?: string): void {

    this.errorCount++;

    this.processedItems++;

    this.logger.error({

      operation: this.name,

      itemId,

      error,

    }, `Error in batch operation: ${this.name}`);

  }

}

```

  

### 2. Progressive Web App Capabilities

  

The application includes full PWA support with:

- **Offline functionality** for viewing past predictions

- **Install prompts** for native app-like experience

- **Service worker** integration for caching strategies

- **Responsive design** optimized for all device sizes

*Progressive Web App installation prompts on mobile and desktop for native app-like experience*

  

### 3. Advanced Logging System

  

Structured logging with Pino provides comprehensive monitoring:

  

```typescript

// Named logger for module identification

import { getLogger } from '@/lib/logger';

const logger = getLogger('my-module-name');

  

logger.info({ someData: 'value' }, 'Info message');

logger.error({ error: errorObj }, 'Error occurred');

```

  

### 4. User Statistics & Performance Tracking

  

Sophisticated statistics tracking includes:

- **Weekly performance metrics**

- **Overall win/loss ratios**

- **Leaderboard rankings**

- **Historical performance analysis**

  

```typescript

export const StatZ = z.object({

  user: z.string().length(15),

  total_picks: z.number().min(0),

  win_picks: z.number().min(0),

  lose_picks: z.number().min(0),

  win_loss_ratio: z.number().min(0).or(z.null()),

  win_pick_rate: z.number().min(0).max(100).or(z.null()),

});

```

*Mobile-first design in action: seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices*

  

## 🔧 Development Experience

  

### Type-Safe Development

  

The entire codebase maintains type safety from database to UI:

  

```typescript

// Database queries are fully typed

const picks: PickType[] = await getPicks(userId);

const matchups: MatchupType[] = await getMatchups(dateCode);

```

  

### Component Architecture

  

React components follow modern patterns with hooks and server state:

  

```tsx

// Example component with proper typing

interface GameCardProps {

  matchup: MatchupType;

  userPick?: PickType;

  onPickSubmit: (pick: Omit<PickType, 'id' | 'created' | 'updated'>) => void;

}

  

export function GameCard({ matchup, userPick, onPickSubmit }: GameCardProps) {

  // Component implementation

}

```

  

### Environment Configuration

  

Comprehensive environment variable management with Astro's built-in validation:

  

```javascript

env: {

  schema: {

    POCKETBASE_URL: envField.string({ context: 'server', access: 'public' }),

    POCKETBASE_PUBLIC_URL: envField.string({ context: 'client', access: 'public' }),

    ADMIN_USER: envField.string({ context: 'server', access: 'public' }),

    POSTHOG_API_HOST: envField.string({ context: 'server', access: 'public' }),

    // ... additional environment variables

  },

}

```
